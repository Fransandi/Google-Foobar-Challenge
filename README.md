# 👨‍💻 Google Foobar Challenge 🧩

> There are a lot of difficult things about being undercover as Commander Lambda's personal assistant, but you have to say, the personal spa and private hot cocoa bar are pretty awesome.

## What is the Google Foobar challenge? 

Google Foobar is such a well-hidden secret that people have a tough time finding credible sources for it on the internet. It aims at hiring one of the best developers and programmers all across the world.

Many developers were not even aware of this Google secret hiring challenge. So, it was when they got an invite that they came to know about the challenge. No one knows when and how it started, but it has been inviting suitable candidates for a potential career at Google.
